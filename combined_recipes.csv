1.0,Apple-Cranberry Crostada,0,0,0,8.0,6 to 8 - servings,"3 tablespoons butter, 2 pounds Granny Smith apples (or other firm, crisp apples), peeled, quartered, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick, 1 pound Macintosh apples (or other soft-textured apples that fall apart when cooked), peeled, quartered, cored, and sliced 1/4-inch thick, ½ cup sugar, ½ cup dried cranberries, 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed but still cold (follow package directions), 1  egg white, lightly beaten, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 cup Optional: Ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream","Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, about 5 minutes longer. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.)
Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.)
Spread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold up pastry borders over apples. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

2.0,Apple Pie by Grandma Ople,30 mins,1 hrs,1 hrs 30 mins,8.0,1 9-inch pie,"8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed, ½ cup unsalted butter, 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, ½ cup white sugar, ½ cup packed brown sugar, ¼ cup water, 1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed","Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.
Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.
Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.
Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.
Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.
Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.

Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.
Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.
Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.
Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.
Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.
Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.

Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.
Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.
Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.
Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.
Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.
Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.

Add brown sugar, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes. Stir together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water. Pour into the skillet, and mix well. Cook for another minute, or until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat to cool slightly.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Unfold puff pastry sheets, and repair any cracks by pressing them back together. Trim each sheet into a square. Then cut each larger square into 4 smaller squares. Spoon apples onto the center of each squares. Fold over from corner to corner into a triangle shape, and press edges together to seal. Place turnovers on a baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between them.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until turnovers are puffed and lightly browned. Cool completely before glazing.
To make the glaze, mix together the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla in a small bowl. Adjust the thickness by adding more sugar or milk if necessary. Drizzle glaze over the cooled turnovers.

Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.
Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.
Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.
Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.
Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.
Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.

Stir apples into hot butter; sprinkle with 1/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and salt. Cook and stir apple mixture until apples are softened, about 5 minutes. Mix in cinnamon and water; continue cooking until apples are soft and sticky, 1 to 2 more minutes. Spread apple filling onto a plate to cool.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
Form a dough piece into a ball, place on a floured work surface, and roll into a circle about 8 inches in diameter. Spoon 1/3 to 1/2 cup apple filling in the center. Fold dough over filling, leaving about 1 inch of dough on the bottom side visible below the top side. Gently press dough closed around filling, using your fingertips.
Fold the overhanging bottom part of dough up over the top edge, working your way around the crust, and pinch the overhang tightly to the top part of the crust.
Crimp the edge tightly closed, pinching a little bit of dough with the thumb and forefinger of one hand and using your index finger on the other hand to push a small notch into the pinched dough. Continue pinching and notching all the way around until crust is tightly crimped together. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Transfer pies onto prepared baking sheet.
Whisk egg with milk in a small bowl until thoroughly combined. Brush top of each hand pie with egg mixture and sprinkle with about 1/4 teaspoon white sugar. Cut 3 small vent holes in the top of each pie.
Bake in the preheated oven until pies are golden brown and filling is bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

Add 2 1/2 cups of the white sugar and stir once every day for 10 days. When not stirring mixture, keep it covered with a paper towel, foil, or a loose lid. Let sit at room temperature. Don't refrigerate it or cover it airtight. A pan of water underneath the jar or bowl will keep the ants out.
Day Ten: Add 1 can of chunk pineapple and its juice. Cut each chunk of pineapple in half. Stir in 1/2 cup of white sugar. Stir once everyday for 10 days. The color should change, and the mixture should foam when stirred.
Day Twenty: Slice each cherry in half, and stir in. Add 2 1/2 cups of the white sugar. Stir once every day for the final 10 days. The cherries will give the juice back its pinkish color.
Day Thirty: Drain fruit and reserve it and the liquid. The fruit will be used in the cake. Pour the liquid into 3 glass or ceramic pint jars. One for you to start your next cake, and two for friends. Cake must be started within 3 days after receiving the starter, or you should freeze the starter to use at a later date. Do not use plastic or metal containers to store liquid!

Add the watermelon rinds, and return to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain the rinds in a colander. Bring the vinegar to a boil with 6 cups of sugar. Remove from the heat, stir in the watermelon rinds, cover, and let stand overnight.
The following day, remove the rinds from the syrup using a slotted spoon, and place them into a clean bowl. Set the stockpot onto the stove over high heat, add 4 cups of sugar, and return the syrup to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the stockpot from the heat, and stir in the watermelon rinds, cover, and let stand overnight.
On day 3, repeat the process above, using only 2 cups of sugar: remove the rinds from the syrup using a slotted spoon, and place them into a clean bowl. Set the stockpot onto the stove over high heat, add 2 cups of sugar, and return the syrup to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the stockpot from the heat, and stir in the watermelon rinds, cover, and let stand overnight. Repeat step 3 every day for 6 more days.
On day 10, sterilize the canning jars, rings and lids in boiling water. Pack the watermelon rinds into sterilized jars, making sure there are no spaces or air pockets on the sides. Add two cloves and one cinnamon stick to each jar. Return the syrup to a boil, and fill the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with boiling water. Carefully lower jars into pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary, until tops of jars are covered by 2 inches of water. Bring water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the stockpot from the heat, and let the jars stand in the water for 2 hours off of the heat.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).

402.0,Pear Tarte Tatin,20 mins,50 mins,1 hrs 25 mins,8.0,8 servings,"1 (15 ounce) package ready-to-use refrigerated pie crust, ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg, ½ teaspoon ground ginger, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 5  firm pears, 2 tablespoons good quality bourbon whiskey, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, ⅔ cup white sugar, 1 pinch salt","Remove refrigerated pie crust from package, and follow manufacturer's suggestions for unrolling crust. Set aside.
Combine nutmeg, ginger, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl.
Peel, quarter, and core 4 pears. Slice each quarter into 3 slices, from core end to bottom, and place in a large bowl. Cut remaining pear in half; peel, and core one half and add to the bowl. Peel, core, and slice the other half as directed above and add to the bowl. Drizzle pears with bourbon and sprinkle with spice-sugar mix, tossing to evenly coat.
Melt butter in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 2/3 cup white sugar and salt to the melted butter, stirring to combine until mixture bubbles, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the single pear half in the center of the skillet. Fan remaining pear slices around the center, core end to the outside of the skillet and stem end toward the center. If possible, turn the pieces in the same direction. Keep adding pear slices, filling in any gaps, until they are all in the skillet.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, undisturbed, until pears are fork-tender and color develops to the liquid, about 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven.
Remove skillet from heat and place unbaked pie shell on top of the fruit, using a fork to tuck the edges of the pie shell toward the bottom of the skillet. Place skillet on the prepared baking sheet in the preheated oven. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake until crust is brown, 28 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Place a heat-safe plate, larger than the skillet, upside down over the crust.
Use oven mitts to grab the plate and skillet together and quickly flip the skillet contents onto the plate; this move is tricky and requires some forearm strength and dexterity.

Using a box grater, grate the cold butter atop the flour mixture. Working quickly and using your hands, break the butter bits into the flour until they're evenly distributed and resemble the size of small peas.
Add 4 tablespoons of water and mix. The mixture will be shaggy at this point. From here, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough comes together (generally about 3 additional tablespoons). Flour a work surface and dump the dough onto it. Knead a few times until it comes together. Form dough into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour, ideally overnight.
Just before the dough is ready to remove from the fridge, mix together the filling. In a medium bowl, toss together the pear slices, brown sugar, cocoa powder, coffee grounds, vanilla extract and salt.
Remove the disk of dough from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for 10 minutes. Liberally flour a work surface and rolling pin. Begin to roll the dough to a 16-inch round, being sure to rotate it every so often to avoid sticking, Using the bottom of a bowl or plate that measures about 6 inches in diameter, cut out 3 circles. Re-roll the scraps to get 1 additional circle.
Arrange the pears slices neatly in a circular pattern in the center of each of the pie crust rounds, leaving about 1 1/2 inch clear at the edges. Fold over the edges to cover about 1/2 inch of the filling. Repeat with the remaining rounds. Transfer the galettes to a baking sheet lined with Reynolds® Parchment Paper and place in the freezer to chill for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.
Lastly, brush the pie crust edges with the egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Transfer to the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Check on the galettes periodically. If at any time the crusts' edges are getting too brown, take a piece of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil and tent over the edges. When the edges are golden brown, remove from the oven. Serve warm with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream.

513.0,Chef John's Sweet Potato Biscuits,20 mins,20 mins,40 mins,8.0,8 large or 12 regular biscuits,"1 large orange-fleshed sweet potato, peeled, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, ½ cup buttermilk, 3 ¼ cups self-rising flour, 1 ½ sticks unsalted butter, frozen, 1 tablespoon melted butter","Cut sweet potato in half lengthwise. Cut each in half again lengthwise, then in half cross-wise. Cut each piece in half to make about 16 evenly sized chunks. Transfer into pot; cover with water and add salt. Bring to a simmer on high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and cook until potatoes are tender, about 17 minutes. Drain thoroughly; return to pot and mash potatoes. You will need 1 1/2 cups mashed sweet potatoes. Cool thoroughly.
Transfer cooled mashed potatoes to a mixing bowl. Add brown sugar and buttermilk. Mix together until well combined.
Place self-rising flour in a separate mixing bowl. Grate frozen butter into flour, tossing with a fork to coat with flour after each addition of about 1/3 to 1/2 stick. This will prevent butter from clumping. Mixture should look like floury pieces of butter. Add sweet potato mixture. Toss with a fork until evenly distributed, but don't overmix.
Transfer mixture onto a lightly floured work surface. Push and press mixture together into a rectangular shape, about 1 1/2 inches thick. Dough will be floury and a bit crumbly. Fold rectangle into thirds, lifting up one-third and folding onto the middle and doing the same with the other side. Dust with a bit of flour if sticking.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with a silicone mat.
Press dough into a rectangle again, about 1 inch thick. Repeat the tri-fold step. Press out into a rectangle, about 1 inch thick. Trim off the rough edges to square off the sides; this will maximize rising. Cut into 8 equal portions. Transfer to prepared baking pan, spacing biscuits evenly. Brush tops lightly with 1 tablespoon melted butter.
Bake in preheated oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.
Mix 4 tablespoons butter (room temperature), pomegranate syrup, and pomegranate juice together in a small bowl. Spread on warm biscuits. Sprinkle with a few pomegranate seeds for garnish.

632.0,Southern-Style Baked Banana Pudding,30 mins,15 mins,45 mins,8.0,1 10-inch pan,4 large eggs,"Separate eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and the yolks into a saucepan.
Add sugar, salt, and 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour to the yolks. Splash in about 1/4 of the milk and start blending mixture with a whisk. Pour in remaining milk and whisk until smooth.
Cook and stir mixture over medium heat until hot to the touch, occasionally dipping your finger in to test. Whisk constantly until custard is thick enough to form ribbons.
Remove custard from heat and add vanilla extract, banana liqueur, and cold butter. Whisk until butter dissolves. Set custard aside.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss banana slices with lemon juice.
Spread a quarter of the custard over the bottom of a baking dish. Add a single layer of vanilla wafers. Cover with 1/2 of the bananas and spread 1/2 of the remaining custard on top. Add another layer of vanilla wafers, using slightly fewer this time. Top with the remaining bananas and custard. Smooth the top and tap dish against the counter to settle the pudding.
Add cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat using the whisk attachment until foamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Spread meringue over the pudding using a soft spatula, creating ridges for contrast.
Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is nicely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.

Mix the imitation crabmeat with mayonnaise in a bowl, and set aside. To roll the sushi, cover a bamboo rolling mat with plastic wrap. Lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap. With wet fingers, firmly pat a thin, even layer of prepared rice over the nori, leaving 1/4 inch uncovered at the bottom edge of the sheet. Sprinkle the rice with about 1/2 teaspoon of sesame seeds, and gently press them into the rice. Carefully flip the nori sheet over so the seaweed side is up.
Place 2 or 3 long cucumber spears, 2 or 3 slices of avocado, and about 1 tablespoon of imitation crab mixture in a line across the nori sheet, about 1/4 from the uncovered edge. Pick up the edge of the bamboo rolling sheet, fold the bottom edge of the sheet up, enclosing the filling, and tightly roll the sushi into a cylinder about 1 1/2 inch in diameter. Once the sushi is rolled, wrap it in the mat and gently squeeze to compact it tightly.

Check doneness after 10 to 15 minutes by dropping a small spoonful of jam onto a frozen plate. Let sit for 1 to 2 minutes; if jam appears to gel, it is ready. Continue cooking if jam appears thin and runny.
Transfer jam into hot sterile jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill it halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Store in a cool, dark area.

1084.0,Reshteh Polo (Persian Noodle Rice),35 mins,1 hrs 10 mins,3 hrs 35 mins,10.0,10 servings,"1 cup basmati rice, 3 ½ tablespoons kosher salt, divided, ¼ teaspoon saffron threads, 2 tablespoons boiling water, ½ (8 ounce) package roasted noodles, ¼ cup grapeseed oil,   kosher salt to taste (such as Diamond Crystal®), 2 medium gold potatoes, sliced into quarter rounds, ¼ cup boiling water, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, 6  Medjool dates, pitted and quartered, ½ cup golden raisins, rinsed and drained, ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon","Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with tepid water. Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches, then tip the bowl to drain water. Repeat this process until water runs clear, about 7 rinses. Cover rice with cold water, add 1/2 tablespoon salt, stir gently, and soak for 1 hour. Drain rice without rinsing.
Crush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside.
Fill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 9 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to the boiling water with the rice. Stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly. Cook until the first rice grain pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more.
Drain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot.
Place the clean pot over medium heat. Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture. Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer.
Gently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice and noodles a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface.
Test the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source. Drizzle the butter mixture over the rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid.
Place a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove. Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 35 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily.
Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add dates, raisins, and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt. Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft, 3 to 5 minutes.
Gently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side.

,Sourdough Bread Boule,,,,,,"10 g mature sourdough starter (10 g) | 100 g whole-wheat flour (100 g), divided | 320 g water (320 g), divided | 300 g bread flour (300 g) | 7 g kosher salt (7 g) | rice flour, for dusting","Place your mature sourdough starter in a bowl, and add 50 grams of the whole-wheat flour and 50 grams of the water (1:5:5 ratio). Mix well, and let it ferment overnight at room temperature (around 75°F) until it doubles in size (this will be your active sourdough starter). | In a large bowl, stir together the bread flour and the remaining 50 grams whole-wheat flour. Add the remaining 270 grams water, and mix using a wooden spoon until all the flour is hydrated. Let this mixture rest for 30 minutes. | Measure out 70 grams of your active sourdough starter, and add it to the dough mixture in the large bowl (reserve the remaining active sourdough starter for the next time you bake). Mix together with your hands until the starter is evenly distributed. Cover the bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes. | Sprinkle the salt over the dough. Use your hands or a dough scraper to incorporate the salt evenly. Cover the bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes. | Perform a series of stretches and folds to develop the gluten. To stretch and fold, grab 1 side of the dough, stretch it upwards, and fold it over the center. Repeat this process from all sides of the dough (four folds total). Cover the bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes. | After the initial stretch and fold, perform a coil fold 3 times every 45 minutes. To make a coil fold, place your hands under the ball of dough. Lift up the dough from the middle, and pull it slightly forward to lift up the front half of the dough from the bowl. Fold the dough down over the front half, tucking the front half under the dough ball. Rotate the dough ball a quarter turn, and repeat. Repeat 2 more times to complete 1 full coil fold around the dough ball. This helps to build strength in the dough. | After 3 rounds of coil folds, let the dough rest until it has visibly risen and increased in volume by 30–50%. This can take 2–3 hours, depending on the temperature of the room. | Gently turn the dough out onto a work surface lightly dusted with rice flour. Shape it into a round or oval loaf, being careful not to deflate it too much. You can use a bench scraper to help shape the dough. | Place the shaped dough, seam side up, into a proofing basket or a bowl lined with a well-floured kitchen towel. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Place in the fridge, and let it cold-proof for at least 8 hours or up to 48 hours. | About 45 minutes before baking, preheat your oven to 485°F. Place a Dutch oven or a heavy, lidded pot inside the oven to preheat as well. | Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the preheated oven. Turn the proofed dough out, seam side down, into the hot pot. Score the top of the dough with a sharp knife or razor blade. Cover with the lid, and bake for 20 minutes. | Reduce the oven temperature to 435°F. Remove the lid from the Dutch oven, and continue baking for 20–25 minutes, until the bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove the bread from the oven.

Use a stainless-steel straw to cut two 'eyes' in each potato half. Next, use a knife to carefully carve a 'mouth' just below the eyes. Draw a horizontal slit, then add several vertical slits along the line to create a 'skeleton mouth.' Repeat this process for all the potatoes and set them aside. | For the carrot pumpkins: Place carrots on a cutting board and make two vertical cuts into the tops of each carrot, about ¼ inch apart. Next, angle your knife to make two diagonal cuts that meet the original cuts, creating triangular sections at the top of the carrots. Lastly, slice the carrots into ¼-inch slices to make little pumpkins. | Prepare the mushrooms: Slice the mushrooms in half lengthwise. Use a stainless-steel straw to poke out the 'eyes' and a knife to make two slits for the 'nose.' You can also add slits with a fork along the stem for extra detail. | Pat the beef dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. | In a large Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Sear the beef until browned on all sides in 3 batches, turning with tongs for about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer the meat to a plate and keep warm. | To the same Dutch oven, add the onion, celery, garlic, and thyme. Cook until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. | Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute. Return the seared beef with its juices to the pot and sprinkle with flour.

Increase the heat and boil until the wine has reduced by half. | Add the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, and sugar. Stir to combine, then bring to a boil. | Cover the Dutch oven with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours. | Remove the pot from the oven and add the carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms. Cover and return to the oven for about 1 more hour, or until the vegetables are tender, the broth is thickened, and the meat is tender. | Remove and discard the bay leaf and thyme.

Mix for 6-8 minutes until a smooth dough forms. If the dough remains too sticky after 8 minutes, add an additional 4 tablespoons of flour. If kneading by hand, mix in a large bowl until a shaggy dough forms, then turn out onto a clean, lightly floured work surface and knead the dough about 10-15 minutes until smooth. | Shape it all into a ball, then cover it with a bowl or kitchen towel and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes. This helps loosen the gluten strands resulting in a chewier, softer dough. | After 30 minutes, shape the rolls. Divide the dough in half and set one half aside, covered to prevent drying out. Roll the remaining half out to about 1 inch thick, and cut into 2½-inch rounds using a cookie cutter. Place the rounds onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining dough. | Allow the dough rounds to rest for 45 minutes until they are soft and puffy. | While the rounds are proofing, prepare the cream cheese filling. In a bowl, mix together the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla extract, egg yolk, and lemon zest.

Whisk to blend. | In another bowl, mix the milk and oil. Pour this mixture onto the flour mixture and stir until combined. | Strain the mixture into a clean, heatproof bowl and let sit for 30 minutes. It will thicken slightly. | Place the bowl on a steamer rack in a steamer, or use a large lidded saucepan partially filled with boiling water as an improvised steamer. Steam for about 25-30 minutes, until the mixture is solid, slightly translucent, and a knife inserted into it comes out nearly clean (a few drops of liquid are fine). | Remove the bowl from the steamer and let it cool on a towel or rack for a few minutes. Scoop the dough onto a clean surface lined with plastic wrap (using plastic wrap is essential; the dough will stick to other surfaces). Cover the dough with another piece of plastic wrap and knead for several minutes until it is very soft and has an oily sheen. This step is crucial to ensure the dough remains soft and workable. Use plastic wrap to avoid sticking to your hands. | To make the mooncakes: Portion out the red bean paste using a 1-inch cookie scoop, placing 20 balls onto a greased plate. | Cover your work surface with plastic wrap. If desired, color the dough. For a marble effect, divide the dough into three portions. Color one portion with matcha, another with blue spirulina, and leave the third portion white. Take about 1 tablespoon each of the white, green, and blue dough. Combine them, roll into a ball, and flatten with your palm until ¼-inch thick. If not making a marble effect, take 3 tablespoons of white dough, roll into a ball, and flatten to ¼-inch thick. | Place a red bean ball in the center of the dough and wrap the dough around it. Roll it gently between your palms to seal and ensure it is evenly wrapped around the filling. | Dust a 50-gram mooncake mold lightly with glutinous rice flour. Fit the mooncake seam side down into the mold and press gently. Place the mold on your work surface and press down firmly to stamp the top. Gently press the mooncake out of the mold. Repeat until all mooncakes are formed. | Place the mooncakes in an airtight container lined with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a few hours. Snow skin mooncakes are typically served cold. If they seem very firm, let them sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes before serving. They will keep for a couple of weeks but are best eaten within a few days of making them. | Enjoy! | Ready for a smarter way to find recipes?

Cook, whisking constantly, for about 3 minutes, until no lumps remain but the roux has not yet browned. While whisking, slowly pour in the milk until evenly incorporated. Whisk in the salt, garlic powder, and nutmeg. Bring to a low simmer and cook, whisking often, until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 8–10 minutes.

Add a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread about 1 heaping cup of béchamel over noodles in an even layer. Top with 1 heaping cup of meat sauce, followed by ¼ cup fontina and ¼ cup grated mozzarella. Add another layer of noodles, arranging in the opposite direction as the first layer, and top with about 1 heaping cup of béchamel.

Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until evenly combined, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, elastic, and cohesive. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. | Shape the rolls: Punch down the dough to deflate it. Turn it out onto a floured surface and divide it into 8 equal portions. Let the portions rest for 10 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. Then, roll each portion into a 4x9-inch rectangle using a rolling pin. | Spread a few cloves of garlic confit and a piece of cheese over the top third of each dough rectangle. Starting from the top edge with the filling, carefully fold the dough over the cheese and garlic, pressing down to enclose the filling completely. Roll the dough tightly from the top, about halfway down, to form a sealed roll. | Using a knife or bench scraper, cut the remaining exposed dough into ½-inch strips, leaving them connected to the top part of the roll, cutting perpendicular to the roll. Continue to roll the dough to form a striped pattern. | Place the stuffed roll in a greased 9-inch square baking pan, seam side down. Repeat with the remaining rolls until you have 8 in total. | Proof and bake the rolls: Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350˚F (180°C). Once the dough has risen, brush the tops with egg wash and bake for 25-30 minutes. If the tops brown too quickly, loosely tent with foil. | Garnish the rolls: Whisk together the melted butter, parsley, and garlic powder and then immediately brush over top of the hot rolls. Garnish with flaky sea salt. | Enjoy! | Ready for a smarter way to find recipes?

,50-Garlic Clove Potato Samosas,,,,,,"4 garlic heads | ⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil | kosher salt, to taste | 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed | 2 teaspoons kosher salt | ¼ cup melted ghee | ½ cup cold water | 1.5 lb russet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks | 3 tablespoons ghee | 1 tablespoon minced ginger | ½ jalapeño, with seeds (minced) | 1 teaspoon cumin seeds | 1 teaspoon ground coriander | 1.5 teaspoons garam masala | ⅓ cup frozen peas | ¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped | ½ tablespoon fresh lemon juice | kosher salt, to taste | 2 cups fresh cilantro leaves, packed | 2 cups fresh mint leaves, packed | 1 jalapeño, seeds removed | 1 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled | 2 garlic cloves | 1 teaspoon toasted cumin seeds | 1 teaspoon kosher salt | 1.5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice | ½ teaspoon sugar | ¼ cup water, plus more as needed | canola oil, for frying","Roast the garlic: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut off the tops of the garlic heads and place them on a large piece of aluminum foil. Drizzle the garlic with olive oil and season with salt. Bring up the corners of the foil around the garlic, then roll closed to form a tight packet. Add the packet to a sheet tray and place in the oven and roast until the garlic is caramelized, about 45 minutes.

,Nian Gao,,,,,,"2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, plus more for frying (optional) | 3 cups water (720 mL), divided, plus more as needed | 2 slices peeled fresh ginger | 12.5 oz brown rock sugar (360 g), or 2 cups (packed) dark brown sugar | 1 lb glutinous rice flour (425 g) | 1 dried jujube | roasted sesame seed, for garnish","Grease a 7-inch round, nonstick baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the oil. | In a medium saucepan, combine 2½ cups (500 ml) of water and the ginger and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. | Uncover the pot, add the rock sugar, and continue simmering until the sugar melts completely, stirring occasionally (if using rock sugar bricks, break the bricks into smaller pieces with your hands to allow it to melt more quickly). | Remove the pot from heat and discard the ginger. Stir in the remaining ½ cup of water to help the syrup cool down, then let sit until the temperature reaches 120˚F (50˚C), about 10 minutes. | While the syrup is cooling, prepare a steamer by filling the bottom with water (make sure there is enough to steam the cake for about 1 hour, but not so much that it touches the bottom of the pan) and bringing the water to a boil over medium heat. Alternatively, you can use a rice cooker to steam the nian gao (see instructions below). | Add the glutinous rice flour to a large bowl and drizzle in the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil. Mix the oil in with your hands. | Once the syrup has cooled, gradually add it to the flour mixture, mixing with your hands or a rubber spatula to combine as you go. Once all of the syrup has been added, continue mixing until the batter is well-combined and no lumps remain. It should be thin enough to drizzle; if needed, stir in additional water, ¼ cup at a time. Pour the batter through a mesh strainer into a separate large bowl to remove any remaining clumps of flour. | Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and tap on the countertop to release any air bubbles. If needed, puncture any air bubbles on the surface with a chopstick. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, if desired (this will prevent any condensation from dripping onto the cake). | Place the nian gao in the steamer, cover, and steam for 45–60 minutes, adding more water to the steamer as needed, until the cake is light brown and sticky when a wooden skewer is inserted into the center, but holds its shape. The cake may puff up, but will settle once cooled. Carefully remove the pan from the steamer and let the cake cool for about 20 minutes. | If desired, invert the pan onto a plate to remove the cake (or serve directly from the pan). Place the jujube at the center of the cake and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Slice and serve fresh for a sweet, sticky, and chewy texture. Alternatively, if left covered at room temperature for a day, the cake will become firmer. Slice and pan-fry the pieces in a bit of neutral oil for a crispy and chewy treat. | Leftover cake will keep covered at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in an airtight container the refrigerator for up to 1 week. | Rice cooker instructions: Pour the batter into a pan that will fit inside the basin of the rice cooker (make sure it is deep enough to hold all of the batter). Set a ceramic ramekin or stacked mason jar lids in th bottom of the rice cooker, place the pan on top, then pour water into the base of the rice cooker until it reaches just below the nian gao pan. Close the lid and cook the cake on the white rice setting. | Enjoy! | Don't let a good recipe slip away.

Remove from the oven. The dough will be a bit crumbly and unset, so let cool for 20–30 minutes. | After cooling slightly, lift the whole shortbread up out of the pan using the parchment paper and set it on a cutting board. Slice into 18–24 bars with a sharp knife, then carefully lift the parchment again to transfer the bars back into the pan to cool completely, 1–2 hours. The cooled shortbread can be wrapped in plastic wrap and kept in a cool, dry place for up to 2 days. | Make the pink peppercorn glaze: Using a spice grinder or a coffee grinder, grind the pink peppercorns into a fine powder. | Add the ground peppercorns to a small bowl, add the powdered sugar and salt, and use a small whisk to combine. Add the milk and continue to whisk until smooth. Add a bit more powdered sugar if the glaze is too thin. | Once the shortbread has cooled completely, remove the bars from the pan and set on a wire rack, spacing about 1 inch apart from one another. Place a baking sheet underneath the rack to catch any frosting drips, if desired.. | Transfer the pink peppercorn glaze to a piping bag, then snip off the tip. Pipe the glaze back and forth across the shortbread cookies. (You could also use a spoon here, instead of a piping bag.)

Dust the pasta sheet with flour and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining portions of pasta dough. | Make the colored pasta: On a clean surface, mix together the remaining 1¼ cups plus 1 tablespoon flour and the beet powder. Make a well in the center and add the remaining egg, 3 egg yolks, and a pinch of salt. Repeat steps 2–5 to make 2 flat pasta sheets, then use the wide noodle/fettuccine setting on the pasta maker to cut the colored pasta into noodles. Dust with flour. | Place a sheet of plain pasta on a floured surface, then arrange a third of the colored noodles on top in a stripe pattern. Gently press the colored noodles down with a rolling pin to adhere. | Carefully run the striped pasta sheet through the pasta maker until your desired thickness is reached. Repeat with the remaining sheets. | Lay out the striped pasta sheets on a floured surface and use a 2½-inch square cutter to cut out squares. Set aside. | Make the cacio e pepe filling: In a food processor, combine the drained ricotta, spinach, nutmeg, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and mozzarella and blend until smooth and rich. Season with salt and pepper to taste. | Assemble the ravioli: Take a square of pasta dough, striped side out, and spoon 1–2 tablespoons of the filling onto the center. Wet the outside edges with water, then fold to make a triangle, gently pressing the edges down to seal. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling. | Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the ravioli and cook until they float to the surface, 60–90 seconds, then remove with a slotted spoon. | Make the brown butter sauce: In a large skillet, melt the butter over low heat. Simmer until lightly browned and aromatic, 8–10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon zest and juice, salt, and pepper, swirling the pan to combine. | Toss the pasta in the skillet with the brown butter sauce to coat. Plate and garnish with the parsley. | Enjoy! | Don't just wing it -- plan it!

,Homemade Vanilla Extract,,,,,,"1 bottle vodka, 750-ml bottle (3 1/4 cups) | 20 vanilla beans, whole or leftover pods from another use","Pour out about ½ cup vodka from the bottle and set aside. | If using new vanilla beans, split the pods down the middle and scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds directly to the vodka bottle, then add the split pods. If using already-scraped vanilla beans, add directly to the vodka bottle. | Carefully pour as much of the reserved ½ cup vodka as possible back into the bottle, leaving about 1 inch of headspace at the top. Screw the cap on to seal tightly. | Shake the bottle vigorously, then let sit at room temperature, out of direct sunlight. For the first few weeks, shake the bottle daily. After 2–3 weeks, the vodka should start to turn a light amber color. At this point, you can shake the bottle every few days or so. After 5 weeks, the vanilla extract is ready to use. Store indefinitely at room temperature out of direct sunlight. | If desired, pour the vanilla extract into smaller, sanitized, resealable glass bottles to give as gifts. | As you use the vanilla extract, you can add more vodka and vanilla beans for as long as you like, continuing the shaking and infusing process. | Enjoy! | Busy?

Add a heaping spoonful of the filling to one half of the dough. Close the empanada maker to seal. Repeat with remaining empanada dough and filling. (If you do not have an empanada maker, line a clean surface with a  sheet of parchment paper. Place a disc of empanada dough on the parchment and moisten the edges with egg wash. Scoop a heaping spoonful of the filling onto one half of the disc. Fold the disc over the filling and press to close, using a fork carefully crimp the edges.) | If air-frying the empanadas, spray the basket with nonstick spray, then add the empanadas in a single layer, spacing about 1 inch apart (work in batches to avoid overcrowding). Brush the tops of the empanadas with egg wash, then cook for 7–10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown. If deep-frying the empanadas, carefully place in the hot oil a few at a time and fry until the dough has bubbled and is deep golden brown in color, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the wire rack to drain and cool slightly. If baking, arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Cut 3 small slits in the top of each empanada to vent, then brush the tops with the egg wash. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. | Enjoy! | Cook smarter, not harder.
