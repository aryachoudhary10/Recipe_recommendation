Mix well, and let it ferment overnight at room temperature (around 75°F) until it doubles in size (this will be your active sourdough starter). | In a large bowl, stir together the bread flour and the remaining 50 grams whole-wheat flour. Add the remaining 270 grams water, and mix using a wooden spoon until all the flour is hydrated. Let this mixture rest for 30 minutes. | Measure out 70 grams of your active sourdough starter, and add it to the dough mixture in the large bowl (reserve the remaining active sourdough starter for the next time you bake). Mix together with your hands until the starter is evenly distributed. Cover the bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes. | Sprinkle the salt over the dough. Use your hands or a dough scraper to incorporate the salt evenly. Cover the bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes. | Perform a series of stretches and folds to develop the gluten.

Cover the bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes. | After the initial stretch and fold, perform a coil fold 3 times every 45 minutes. To make a coil fold, place your hands under the ball of dough. Lift up the dough from the middle, and pull it slightly forward to lift up the front half of the dough from the bowl. Fold the dough down over the front half, tucking the front half under the dough ball. Rotate the dough ball a quarter turn, and repeat. Repeat 2 more times to complete 1 full coil fold around the dough ball. This helps to build strength in the dough. | After 3 rounds of coil folds, let the dough rest until it has visibly risen and increased in volume by 30–50%.

Use a stainless-steel straw to cut two 'eyes' in each potato half. Next, use a knife to carefully carve a 'mouth' just below the eyes. Draw a horizontal slit, then add several vertical slits along the line to create a 'skeleton mouth.' Repeat this process for all the potatoes and set them aside. | For the carrot pumpkins: Place carrots on a cutting board and make two vertical cuts into the tops of each carrot, about ¼ inch apart. Next, angle your knife to make two diagonal cuts that meet the original cuts, creating triangular sections at the top of the carrots. Lastly, slice the carrots into ¼-inch slices to make little pumpkins. | Prepare the mushrooms: Slice the mushrooms in half lengthwise. Use a stainless-steel straw to poke out the 'eyes' and a knife to make two slits for the 'nose.' You can also add slits with a fork along the stem for extra detail. | Pat the beef dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. | In a large Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Sear the beef until browned on all sides in 3 batches, turning with tongs for about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer the meat to a plate and keep warm. | To the same Dutch oven, add the onion, celery, garlic, and thyme. Cook until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. | Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute. Return the seared beef with its juices to the pot and sprinkle with flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until the flour is cooked, 1-2 minutes. | Deglaze the pot with the wine, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom. Increase the heat and boil until the wine has reduced by half. | Add the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, and sugar. Stir to combine, then bring to a boil. | Cover the Dutch oven with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours. | Remove the pot from the oven and add the carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms. Cover and return to the oven for about 1 more hour, or until the vegetables are tender, the broth is thickened, and the meat is tender. | Remove and discard the bay leaf and thyme.

Mix for 6-8 minutes until a smooth dough forms. If the dough remains too sticky after 8 minutes, add an additional 4 tablespoons of flour. If kneading by hand, mix in a large bowl until a shaggy dough forms, then turn out onto a clean, lightly floured work surface and knead the dough about 10-15 minutes until smooth. | Shape it all into a ball, then cover it with a bowl or kitchen towel and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes. This helps loosen the gluten strands resulting in a chewier, softer dough. | After 30 minutes, shape the rolls. Divide the dough in half and set one half aside, covered to prevent drying out. Roll the remaining half out to about 1 inch thick, and cut into 2½-inch rounds using a cookie cutter. Place the rounds onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap.

Whisk to blend. | In another bowl, mix the milk and oil. Pour this mixture onto the flour mixture and stir until combined. | Strain the mixture into a clean, heatproof bowl and let sit for 30 minutes. It will thicken slightly. | Place the bowl on a steamer rack in a steamer, or use a large lidded saucepan partially filled with boiling water as an improvised steamer. Steam for about 25-30 minutes, until the mixture is solid, slightly translucent, and a knife inserted into it comes out nearly clean (a few drops of liquid are fine). | Remove the bowl from the steamer and let it cool on a towel or rack for a few minutes. Scoop the dough onto a clean surface lined with plastic wrap (using plastic wrap is essential; the dough will stick to other surfaces). Cover the dough with another piece of plastic wrap and knead for several minutes until it is very soft and has an oily sheen. This step is crucial to ensure the dough remains soft and workable. Use plastic wrap to avoid sticking to your hands. | To make the mooncakes: Portion out the red bean paste using a 1-inch cookie scoop, placing 20 balls onto a greased plate. | Cover your work surface with plastic wrap. If desired, color the dough. For a marble effect, divide the dough into three portions. Color one portion with matcha, another with blue spirulina, and leave the third portion white. Take about 1 tablespoon each of the white, green, and blue dough. Combine them, roll into a ball, and flatten with your palm until ¼-inch thick. If not making a marble effect, take 3 tablespoons of white dough, roll into a ball, and flatten to ¼-inch thick. | Place a red bean ball in the center of the dough and wrap the dough around it. Roll it gently between your palms to seal and ensure it is evenly wrapped around the filling. | Dust a 50-gram mooncake mold lightly with glutinous rice flour. Fit the mooncake seam side down into the mold and press gently. Place the mold on your work surface and press down firmly to stamp the top. Gently press the mooncake out of the mold. Repeat until all mooncakes are formed. | Place the mooncakes in an airtight container lined with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a few hours. Snow skin mooncakes are typically served cold. If they seem very firm, let them sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes before serving. They will keep for a couple of weeks but are best eaten within a few days of making them. | Enjoy! | Ready for a smarter way to find recipes?

Shape into 5–6 large, shaggy meatballs. | Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the meatballs and brown on all sides, 1–2 minutes per side. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and repeat with the remaining meatballs. | Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion. Season with salt and sauté until translucent, 5–7 minutes. | Add the garlic, thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, and fennel seeds. Sauté for 1 minute, until the garlic is fragrant. | Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, until the color turns dark red, 3–4 minutes. | Deglaze the pot with the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom, and cook until the liquid has almost evaporated, 1–2 minutes. | Add the canned tomatoes, strained tomatoes, carrot, butter, the browned meatballs, and 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1½–2 hours, until the sauce has thickened. | Remove the sauce from the heat and discard the carrot, then use a potato masher to crush the meatballs into small pieces. Season the sauce with more salt to taste. If the sauce tastes too acidic, add the sugar. Stir in the basil leaves and set aside. | Make the béchamel sauce: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Once the butter starts to foam, add the flour. Cook, whisking constantly, for about 3 minutes, until no lumps remain but the roux has not yet browned. While whisking, slowly pour in the milk until evenly incorporated. Whisk in the salt, garlic powder, and nutmeg. Bring to a low simmer and cook, whisking often, until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 8–10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. | Assemble the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9 x 13 x 3-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. | Add the Signature SELECT® Pasta Oven Ready Lasagna Noodles to a large baking dish or bowl. Cover with hot water and add the olive oil. Let sit for 5-10 minutes, until the noodles are a bit more pliable, but still snap when broken in half. | Spread about ¾ cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread about 1 heaping cup of béchamel over noodles in an even layer. Top with 1 heaping cup of meat sauce, followed by ¼ cup fontina and ¼ cup grated mozzarella. Add another layer of noodles, arranging in the opposite direction as the first layer, and top with about 1 heaping cup of béchamel. Repeat to make 4 more layers, ending with a layer of lasagna noodles. | Spread 1 cup of béchamel, then 1 cup of meat sauce over the noodles. Scatter the remaining ½ cup of fontina, the fresh mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. Reserve the remaining meat sauce for serving. Cover the baking dish with a sheet of foil (grease the underside with nonstick spray to prevent the cheese from sticking) and place on a rimmed baking sheet. | Bake the lasagna for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 25–30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Broil for 1–2 minutes, if desired, to brown the cheese. Remove from the oven and let the lasagna sit for at least 20 minutes to cool. | Garnish the lasagna with the basil, then serve with the reserved meat sauce alongside. | Enjoy!","data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="

Pack tightly and put plastic wrap on top of the jar before closing the lid. | Store at room temperature for about 2 days, then place in the refrigerator to slow down the fermentation. TIP: If you notice the kimchi expanding or rising up from the fermentation, open the jar and press down to repack it tightly.

Add a heaping spoonful of the filling to one half of the dough. Close the empanada maker to seal. Repeat with remaining empanada dough and filling. (If you do not have an empanada maker, line a clean surface with a  sheet of parchment paper. Place a disc of empanada dough on the parchment and moisten the edges with egg wash. Scoop a heaping spoonful of the filling onto one half of the disc. Fold the disc over the filling and press to close, using a fork carefully crimp the edges.) | If air-frying the empanadas, spray the basket with nonstick spray, then add the empanadas in a single layer, spacing about 1 inch apart (work in batches to avoid overcrowding). Brush the tops of the empanadas with egg wash, then cook for 7–10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown. If deep-frying the empanadas, carefully place in the hot oil a few at a time and fry until the dough has bubbled and is deep golden brown in color, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the wire rack to drain and cool slightly. If baking, arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Cut 3 small slits in the top of each empanada to vent, then brush the tops with the egg wash. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. | Enjoy! | Cook smarter, not harder.
